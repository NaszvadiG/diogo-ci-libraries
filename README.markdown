Diogo's CodeIgniter Libraries
======================================

This is my personal collection of CodeIgniter libraries that I've built during the time I've been working with CodeIgniter. Under each library folder you will find a more detailed description and usage examples.


Current libraries
------------------

* *Clickatel* - A small class to send SMS messages throught Clickate's HTTP API

* *Authentication* - A class that works with Doctrine ORM to authenticate an user. Supports both email/password and Facebook login.
