Authentication Library
---------------------------------

This library was developed to work with a CI installation that featured Doctrine integration. The ORM integration with the framework basically follows the process described here - http://docs.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-orm/en/2.0.x/cookbook/integrating-with-codeigniter.html - with small tweaks here and there.

The library supports a login via email/password and via Facebook.
